HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">

There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". 
If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">

The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

The lang Attribute
 to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.
Example
<html lang="en">

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

HTML Headings
HTML headings are defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<h5>Heading 5</h5>
<h6>Heading 6</h6>

HTML Horizontal Rules
The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.

The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:

Example
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr>

This is heading 1
This is some text.

--------------------------

This is heading 2
This is some other text.

--------------------------

This is heading 2
This is some other text.


HTML Line Breaks
The HTML <br> element defines a line break.

Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:

Example
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p>

o/p :
This is
a paragraph
with line breaks.


<p>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</p>

o/p :
My Bonnie lies over the ocean. My Bonnie lies over the sea. My Bonnie lies over the ocean. Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.

Solution - The HTML <pre> Element
The HTML <pre> element defines preformatted text.

The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:

<pre>
  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  My Bonnie lies over the sea.

  My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

  Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
</pre>


o/p :
   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.

   My Bonnie lies over the sea.

   My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
   
   Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
